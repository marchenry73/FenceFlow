-- Restores the SEE_MONEY guard job_costing() lost.
--
-- supabase_money_report_guard.sql had replaced current_company_id() inside
-- job_costing() and ar_aging() with money_scope_company_id(), which returns
-- NULL for a caller without SEE_MONEY so the report comes back EMPTY rather
-- than erroring. supabase_job_costing_material_budget.sql then rewrote
-- job_costing() to add quoted_material, starting from a body that predated
-- that guard -- so the guard silently went back to current_company_id().
-- job_costing() is SECURITY DEFINER, so the table RLS that hides money from
-- crew does not run inside it; this helper is the only thing standing there.
--
-- tests/company-golden-path.test.mjs checks for exactly this and had been
-- failing on it, behind an earlier error that stopped the section before it.
--
-- Same signature, same columns, same order, quoted_material included. The
-- only change is the helper name, 6 times.
